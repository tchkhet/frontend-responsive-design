        <h3>Born in the nations capital, Gallant breaks outdated social archetypes as a male vocalist who wears the
            duality of raw vulnerability and inspiring strength on his sleeve. His introspective lyrics and superhuman
            falsetto encaptures multiple generations, all moved by his timeless talents that shape his poetic
            self-reflection in this attention-deficit society.
            Labeled as the "breakthrough artist of 2015" and "the voice that will redefine R&B" by Billboard and NME
            respectively, the young Los Angeles artist identifies his music as future soul, bridging contemporary
            productions with old school songwriting. His first single for the critically acclaimed album - Ology, Weight
            in Gold, was handpicked by the esteemed Zane Lowe as the "Single of the Week" during Apple Music's widely
            anticipated launch.
            Selected to play with Elton John and at the White House, Gallant became music's worst kept secret, and his
            personal project, the 'In the Room' original live performance series, attracted household names like Sufjan
            Stevens, Seal, Patrick Stump, and more. Soon, coverage from publications like The Fader, Pitchfork, and
            Entertainment Weekly catapulted him into the conversation as the next breakthrough artist to watch in 2016.
            On December 6th, Ology was nominated for a Grammy as the Best Urban Contemporary Album of 2017. Just days
            into the new year, Gallant was also named a Forbes "30 Under 30 of 2017" and became the featured nominee for
            music.</h3>
